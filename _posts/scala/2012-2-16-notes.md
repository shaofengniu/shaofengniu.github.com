Variance in scala
-----------------

We take the Function for an example.

{% highlight scala %}
trait Function [-T1, +R] extends AnyRef
class A
class B extends A
class C extends B
class D extends C
val f: (B =\> C) = (a: A =\> new D)
{% endhighlight %}

That means, you need to give a more specific type to the function and return a
more specific type to the outside world.

So the *"+"* and *"-"* are used to tell the relationship between C[A] and C[B]
when A is a subclass of B.

According to twitter's effective scala, immutable collections should be
covariant and mutable collections should be invariant.

Bounds
------

"U \<: T" defines T as the upper bound for U. So U is required to be a subclass
of T.

Upper bounds are used to provide more constrains on type parameters.

{% highlight scala %}
class F {def foo = "F" }
def callFoo[T \<: F](foos: Seq[T]) = foos map (_.foo) foreach println
{% endhighlight %}

Without the *"\<: F"*, the def will produce a *"not a member"* error.

"U \>: T" defines T as the lower bound for U. So U is required to be a supersype
of T.

Since method parameters are by default contravariant, we can't pass a more
generalized value to the method. But if we actually need this behaviour, we can
use the lower bound combined with covariant to tell the compile "that's fine,
just do what i said".

{% highlight scala %}
scala\> (new Node(new B)).sub(new B)
res0: Node[B] = Node@116dd645
scala\> (new Node(new B)).sub(new B).sub(new A)
res1: Node[A] = Node@70d5fcfe
scala\> (new Node(new B)).sub(new B).sub(new A).sub(new B)
res2: Node[A] = Node@314b4e26
{% endhighlight %}

According to the third statement, I guess the "\>:" means the method *can
*accept a more generalized parameter, but not mandatory.

View bounds
-----------

Once we defined a implicit transformation function from type A to B, we can use
A in any place requiring a type viewable as B.

{% highlight scala %}
scala\> implicit def strToInt(x: String) = x.toInt
strToInt: (x: String)Int
scala\> val y: Int = "123"
y: Int = 123
scala\> class Container[A \<% Int] { def addIt(x: A) = 123 + x }
defined class Container
scala\> (new Container[String]).addIt("123")
res11: Int = 246
{% endhighlight %}
